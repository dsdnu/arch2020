\section{Conclusion and Future Work}
\label{sec:conclusion}
In this paper, we discussed the design, implementation and performance evaluation of StocNoC, a network on chip based solution for stochastic modeling.
Experimental results show that the proposed architecture can accelerate the spreading model by many orders compared to software implementation on cloud-infrastructure and can provide significant financial benefits to users.
The proposed model can be easily adapted to other scenarios such as social information diffusion, wireless malware propagation and viral marketing.
It is shown that a hardware-based solution can significantly outperform software simulation in terms of run-time and at the same time, provide scalability due to the NoC-based architecture. 

As future work, partial reconfiguration and structural reconfiguration will be evaluated for modeling large scale networks. We intend to extend and demonstrate the effectiveness of the platform in modeling multiple competitive processes in multi-layered networks. 
We believe that modeling of spreading dynamics will provide new research directions to the hardware accelerator research community.
For generating research interest, the HDL implementation and the dataset used for evaluation are available as open source from the following git repository~\cite{sisNoC}.
